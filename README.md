# RestaurantWaitingListSystem
CS 211 Program 4. Implement a customer waiting list that might be used by a restaurant.
When people want to be seated in the restaurant, they give their name and group
size to the host/hostess and then wait until those in front of them have been seated. The program
must use a linked list to implement the queue-like data structure.
The linked list is to maintain the following information for each group that is waiting:
• name (we assume a maximum name length of 30 characters)
• group size
• in-restaurant status: whether the group has called ahead or is waiting in the restaurant
